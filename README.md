# READ THIS BEFORE CONTINUING
This only works with Python 3+, This is due to PySimpleGUI requiring it.
# A quick note
If you want to see a demo of the program you can call FormMaker.demo() to see a demo form with all elements  
Also the way the code is structred when you have more than one multichoice or select all that apply, Duplicate layout messages may appear in the terminal, This is normal. When you recive your response from the form it sometimes looks like this:
